<p>
Three and a half years ago, I started to study and become a practitioner of improvised comedy and drama, improvised dance, and open/cold-water swimming. These are very life-enriching experiences, filled with an authentic sense of creativity. And at their core, they all work the same way: improvising in a slightly challenging physical and social world with a playful spirit and with continuous real-time feedback releases the mind, connects us to others and induces a flow experience.
</p>

<p>
A year ago, I began to look for ways to replicate the essence of these experiences in a form that can happen anywhere and for anybody: a low-cost, portable, physically and creatively engaging setup, open to playful interaction and social connection from the start.
</p>

<p>
This has led to the development of a series of Audio-Visual instrument prototypes, which allow non-musicians (such as myself) to creatively and intuitively explore various soundscapes and perform together. Some of these have also been demonstrated in front of audiences, and have been evaluated as part of a research project.
</p>

<p>
The target audience for such an Audio-Visual instrument is the average non-musician who still wants to experience the fulfillment of musical exploration and creativity. 
</p>

<p>
The biggest challenge in order to take this project forward is the hardware experimentation necessary to develop a robust tangible interface for it.
</p>

<p>
And this line of work has not yet become a source of income, but my aim is to bring my inspirations and interests under one creative and career umbrella. I believe this programme will help me achieve this aim.
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-2">
<pre class="example">

</pre>

<p>
My ambition for the next 5 years is to find ways to help people regularly exercise their curiosity ("I wonder what happens when I do this?"), their creativity ("I didn't realise just how much time has passed!") and playfulness ("Have a look at this, let's do it together!").
</p>

<p>
These are experiences that I value and enjoy, and I not only want them for others but believe that working towards this goal also adds meaning to the work itself.
</p>

<p>
I am planning to achieve this by building a software+hardware platform that is easily and intuitively accessible; that is affordable and portable, and therefore widely available; that encourages people to interact with the physical and social world around them; and crucially, a platform that people themselves can modify and expand.
</p>

<p>
We are now at a technological stage where this is possible. And my ambition is to earn a meaningful living while helping to bring it forth.

<p>
The project I'm proposing is a Low-cost, Portable, Tangible User Interface. And as its first application, it will be used to implement a Musical Instrument that can be played collaboratively.
</p>

<p>
Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) are bridges between the digital and physical worlds that we inhabit, making the latter accessible and manipulable, by using the real world as a display and as medium for manipulation. Ideally, the entire world could become an interface.
</p>

<p>
One such instance is the Tabletop tangible interface, or Interactive surface, so called because a horizontal surface is used by one or more people to interact with a digital model. A popular example is the "reacTable Modular Synthesizer" which allows the creation of electronic music through tangible tokens that are visually connected to each other by the underlying display.
</p>

<p>
reacTable was born in 2003 and became a commercial product in 2008. It has certainly succeeded in its foremost goal to be "an attractive, intuitive and non-intimidating musical instrument for multi-user electronic music performance". But it is very expensive to buy one, and it is physically not suitable to move around. Some makers and research groups around the world have built their own, more affordable reacTable clones, but this path isn't accessible for the majority of people, and the final objects are still the size of a table. In other words, for a platform so successful in what it does and so rich in its potential, it is practically inaccessible but by a few.
</p>

<p>
Today, it is possible to achieve the same goals that reacTable had set, using current technology that is much more affordable and portable &#x2013; and thereby making the final system truly widely-available.
</p>

<p>
And it is possible to start doing this in more than one way, with a variety of capability and budget points. In addition to a personal allowance of Â£6000 for 6 months of living expenses (is this too much? too little?), the maximum development cost will be in the region of Â£2000-Â£3000.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-4">
<pre class="example">

</pre>

<p>
The historical roots of my work are in the Graphical Sound and Optical Synthesis movements. 
</p>

<p>
I am inspired by the ideals of some of these early pioneers: that "music does not need to be written in a musical score but can be made in a more free and expressive way" (Oskar Fischinger, 1932); and "the possibilities of composition can be open to those with no formal musical training, allowing them to create music in a direct, intuitive way" (Xenaxis, 1977). 
</p>

<p>
My work so far has aimed at exploring different and intuitive ways of making music, and it has been well received by others, but it is certainly not alone in this regard. 
</p>

<p>
I think of its next step as its most interesting and innovative evolution: creating a platform that can be used to implement a variety of tangible musical instruments, utilising everyday objects, playable by anybody, anywhere.
</p>

<p>
Again, it will not be alone in this regard &#x2013; there are a few other examples (eg "mogees.com") aiming at a similar goal but in a different way. What's important is that, collectively, I see these efforts as the true democratisation of music creation. 
</p>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-5">
<pre class="example">
200 words max.
</pre>

<p>
I think technology as humankind's way to amplify and modify its behavioural and conceptual abilities and make-up &#x2013; for better and worse. Each technological step we take has implications for how we relate to the world around us, how we relate to the world inside us, and how we relate to each other.
</p>

<p>
I am particularly interested in developing and employing new technologies to create new creative paths for people who may not otherwise have access to.
</p>

<p>
And I am very excited by the reduced form-factor and increased affordability of a number of key technologies, expanding both the variety of the creative experiences we can have and the variety of environments we can have them in.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-6">
<pre class="example">

</pre>

<p>
My primary skillset is in software, and I work comfortably with many programming languages and platforms &#x2013; including enterprise java programming, the Processing platform, PureData for sound synthesis, the web browser as a platform, and application development on mobile devices. My work regularly involves designing systems to help navigate and make sense of large volumes of data, and I use Machine Learning to this end.
</p>

<p>
I also have experience working with the Arduino, have done a personal project using Kinect, and have used Screen printing and Intaglio printing in the last 6 months.
</p>

<p>
I design interactive systems, but I have never formally studied interaction design. This is an area where I want to grow more.
</p>

<p>
I would like to continue learning about audio processing and computer vision techniques, as these are essential aspects of intuitive interfaces. 
</p>

<p>
I would also want to develop enough electronics and CNC-based fabrication know-how for building from scratch bespoke devices that are small, self-contained, low-cost, and low-power, with some basic I/O capabilities. These open up design paths that are less accessible using only off-the-shelf products.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-7">
<pre class="example">
200 words max.
</pre>


<p>
Firstly, why Makerversity? 
</p>

<p>
This time last year, I set some criteria and started searching for a setup that will allow me to 1) integrate a creative practice; 2) practice new skills with fabrication technologies; 3) enter a new community and network of like-minded people; and 4) develop a new direction and career. 
</p>

<p>
To this end, I have researched, applied, got accepted, and nearly enrolled into some masters programmes &#x2013; but I couldn't justify it in the end because they all fell short of the above criteria somehow.
</p>

<p>
After coming across and talking to people at Makerversity, I feel it is the best answer that satisfies the goals I started with.
</p>

<p>
Why MVWorks?
</p>

<p>
Because, again, it is such a close match to what I am after. I am at a point to change direction and start a new career. I know my chances are higher if I can do this as part of a programme with a structure, with deadlines, with a well-defined goal / a showcase in the end, and with an audience to keep me engaged and enthusiastic. I also know I benefit a lot from mentoring support, especially when starting out. And I want to be doing this as part of a network and supportive community. 
</p>

<p>
These are all the things I had already been looking for. 
</p>

<p>
It is serendipity that MVWorks was announced the day I visited Makerversity for the first time.

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-unnumbered-10">
<p>
The 1978 BBC Horizon documentary "When the chips are down".  Not only is it very informative about the early history of digital computers, it also raises issues that are still very relevant today &#x2013; issues about the social impact of the then-emerging technologies of computers and computerised automation. 
</p>

<p>
Any person who works with or advances technology will both enjoy watching the documentary and be stimulated by its debate.
</p>

<p>
Also, it has an amazing footage of a microchip filmed under an electron scanning microscope, and one actually gets to see the electrons flowing from gate to gate!
