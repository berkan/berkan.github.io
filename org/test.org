At rates near that of the heartbeat, we perceive repetition directly as rhythm. At the fastest rates, the repetitions blur together into the perception called “pitch.” Thus we perceive rhythmic patterns differently at different time scales. -- [[http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781846286391][Rhythm and Transforms]]

*Cantor Dust* is an instrument that generates both the timbre and the rhythm/tempo of its samples using the very same fractal process.

#+ATTR_HTML: :border 0 :rules "" :frame ""
|Fractals are created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop. The resulting structure exhibits a repeating pattern at every scale.         |
|[[file:images/ani_cantor.gif]] |

A traditional [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cantor_set][Cantor set]] system, for instance, divides a line repeatedly by taking out the middle-third of its segments. The result --what is left from the line-- is an infinite set of points (which is where the name Cantor Dust comes from).

*Reflection*
The strength of drawing-based musical instruments is also their weakness: they are very intuitive because the audio-visual mapping is direct, precise, and free from additional semantics -- but the very same directness and lack of semantics make building up to a composition difficult.

The same is true for Modulant. As a tool for sound design and exploration, it offers infinite possibilities; however, its visual language and painterly interface are both too precise and not rich enough at the same time for comfortably devising musical compositions.
