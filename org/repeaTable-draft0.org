#+BEGIN_DESCRIPTION


*Tangible User Interfaces* (TUIs) are bridges between the digital and physical worlds that we inhabit, making the former accessible and manipulable, by using the real world as a display and as medium for manipulation. 

One such instance is the *Tabletop tangible interface*, or Interactive surface, so called because a horizontal surface is used by one or more people to interact with a digital model. 

This is a systematic exploration of possible designs for a *low-cost* and *portable* Tabletop tangible interface.

The design of any tangible user interface needs to address how exactly and by which means to create the connections between the digital and physical worlds -- that is:

- *Physical -> Digital* : How to sense and transfer the state of the physical world and the actions of the users into the digital model 
- *Digital -> Physical* : How to convey the state of the digital world to the user(s) in the physical world 




Tangible User Interfaces (TUIs) are bridges between the digital and physical worlds that we inhabit, making the former accessible and manipulable, by using the real world as a display and as medium for manipulation. 

One such instance is the Tabletop tangible interface, or Interactive surface, so called because a horizontal surface is used by one or more people to interact with a digital model. A popular example is the "reacTable Modular Synthesizer" which allows the creation of electronic music through tangible tokens that are visually connected to each other by the underlying display.
